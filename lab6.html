    <p>
        Indonesia, is the largest archipelago in the world and is situated between the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea. It is bordered by Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, and Timor-Leste. The country consists of a number of small to large sized islands (between,
        13,000 to 17,000). Its largest islands are Sumatra, Java (with more than half of the country's population), Borneo (known as "Kalimantan" in Indonesia), Sulawesi, and New Guinea. Most of the larger islands are mountainous up to 3,800 m tall.
    </p>

    <p>
        The whole country lies in the south western arm of the Ring of Fire, an arc of volcanic activity. The islands of Indonesia are prone to earthquakes and tsunamis. With a population of 258 million people (in 2016), Indonesia is the largest and most populous
        country situated only on islands, with a combined area of an area slightly smaller than Mexico. The Capital city of Indonesia is Jakarta on the island of Java, with a population of 10 million. The national language is Indonesian.

        extensive communications network with the rest of the country and the outside world. From the Capital City, sophisticated land, air, and sea transport is available to the rest of the country and beyond.

    <p>
        Finding its origin in the small early 16th century harbor town of Sunda Kelapa, Jakarta's founding is thought to have taken place on June 22, 1527, when it was re-named Jayakarta.The Dutch East Indies Company changed its name into Batavia and made it
        the center for the expansion of their power in the East Indies. Shortly after the outbreak of World War II, Batavia fell into the hands of the invading Japanese forces that changed the name of the city into 'Jakarta' as a way of winning over Indonesians.
        The name was kept after Indonesia achieved national independence after the war's end.

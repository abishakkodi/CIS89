    <p>
        Jakarta is the capital city of the Republic of Indonesia, a country composed of more than 13,000 islands with a population of over 180 million. Located on the northern coast of West Java, it is the center of government, commerce and industry and has an
        extensive communications network with the rest of the country and the outside world. From the Capital City, sophisticated land, air, and sea transport is available to the rest of the country and beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
        Jakarta is one of Indonesia's designated tourist areas. It has the largest and most modern airport in the country, the most important harbor in Indonesia and is well connected by rail of good roads to other destinations in Java, Sumatra, and Bali.

    </p>

    <p>
        Finding its origin in the small early 16th century harbor town of Sunda Kelapa, Jakarta's founding is thought to have taken place on June 22, 1527, when it was re-named Jayakarta.The Dutch East Indies Company changed its name into Batavia and made it
        the center for the expansion of their power in the East Indies. Shortly after the outbreak of World War II, Batavia fell into the hands of the invading Japanese forces that changed the name of the city into 'Jakarta' as a way of winning over Indonesians.
        The name was kept after Indonesia achieved national independence after the war's end.

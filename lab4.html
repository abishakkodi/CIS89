    <h1>Emperor Norton of San Francisco</h1>
    <p>San Francisco Resident, Joshua Abraham Norton (1818 -1880), was a citizen of San Francisco, California, who in 1859 proclaimed himself "Norton I, Emperor of the United States" and later on "Protector of Mexico". This eccentric man had no real political power, yet the residents of San Francisco treated him like an emperor. His benefits included free food at restaurants, complimentary tickets to movies and plays, and deference from locals and tourists alike. </p>

    <p>General introduction to Emperor Norton: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Norton"> Emperor Norton </a> </p>

    <p>Newspapers recorded and spread Norton I’s sometimes bizzare proclamations in their publications. He declared that anyone who referred to his city by the word 'Frisco,' would have to pay a $25 fine. One of the most famous edicits arrived in the early 1870s, when his majesty proclaimed that the city should set aside money for the creation of a bridge and tunnel between San Francisco and Oakland. Ignored at the time, Norton I’s decree became fact in 1936 with the opening of the Bay Bridge followed by the transbay BART tunnel in 1970, nearly 100 years later.</p>

    <p id = "skyblue"> While Norton died suddenly of apoplexy in 1880 while making his daily rounds of the city; he still remained Emperor of the city by the Bay. His loyal subjects along with the whole city mourned the loss of their Emperor. Though he was but a pauper, funeral and burial arrangements for his majesty were the most elaborate the city had seen, with an estimated 20,000 people paying their last respects. With wealthy San Franciscans bearing his expenses, Norton was laid to rest in a San Francisco cemetary with all the pomp that a real emperor would have received.
